WORD(1)

NAME
    word - Python per-line text editor.

SYNOPSIS
    word [WORD_INDICES | PYTHON_COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
    Word prints the Nth word of each line of text.
    Alternatively, word runs a Python command on each line of text.  
    If the input argument is an integer N, then word print the Nth word of each line.
    Otherwise, the argument will be parsed as a Python command to run on each line of text.

    The command has access to the following variables:

        line - String, the full text of the current line

        words - List of strings, equivalent to line.split()

        tabs - List of strings, equivalent to line.split('\t')

    If the command outputs a list, it will be converted to a string by ' '.join()

EXAMPLES
    Print the fourth word on every line:

        word 3

    Print the first and last word of every line:

        cat mytext.txt | word 0,-1

    Print the third and first entries in a tab-delimited CSV text file:

        cat foo.csv | word tabs[2],tabs[0]

    In a tab-delimited CSV file, print all entries except the last three:

        cat foo.csv | word tabs[:-3]

    Print Alice in Wonderland, removing every word that begins with the letter K

        curl lwneal.com/alice.txt | word '[w for w in words if not w.startswith("k")]'

    Print the numbers from 1 to 100.
    But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 

        seq 100 | word '"fizzbuzz" if not int(line) % 15 else "fizz" if not int(line) % 5 else "buzz" if not int(line) % 3 else line'

    In Vim, replace all selected text with the second word of each line

        !word 1
